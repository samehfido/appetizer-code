Securizer protects your sensitive documents by encrypting them.

== USAGE ==

- When Appetizer closes, Securizer asks you for the password you'd like to use to encrypt your documents. Choose a password long enought - between 4 to 20 characters.
- Then the next time Appetizer is opened, you will be asked for your password again. Input it and your documents will be decrypted.

== TECHNICAL DETAILS ==

- Securizer uses ccrypt for the encryption and uses the safest encryption method so there is no risk of losing files, even if ccrypt or Appetizer crashes.
- Encrypted files are given a unique extension (.ccrypt1_7). This ensure that a file will not be accidentally encrypted twice (or decrypted when it's not encrypted).

== LICENSE ==

- Securizer is released under the same license of Appetizer, as of January 2010

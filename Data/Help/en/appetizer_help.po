"Appetizer is a dock bar that allows you to organize, display and launch your "
"applications and other shortcuts. Currently it is possible to add "
"executables, documents and folders to the dock. Additionally, if you use "
"Appetizer on a USB key in the [http://portableapps.com PortableApps] format, "
"the application will detect it and automatically import all your "
"applications along with the 'Documents', 'Videos', 'Music' and 'Pictures' "
